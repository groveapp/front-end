# Grove, An Accountability Platform

This is the GitHub repository for Grove, an endeavor to build a tool where citizens and our leaders can learn about each othersâ€™ thoughts and actions, forge new movements, and share ideas with the common goal of building a better future.

More often than not, leaders and the people they represent are talking past each other. We want to realign our institutions with the public by adding citizens back into the decision-making process.
